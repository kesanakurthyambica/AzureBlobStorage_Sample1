# Azure Blob Storage Project

This project demonstrates how to create and configure an Azure Blob Storage account, set up a blob container, upload a file (blob), and verify access permissions.

## Steps Overview

1. **Create Storage Account**: Set up a new storage account in Azure with standard performance and locally-redundant storage.  
2. **Enable Soft Delete**: Enable soft delete for blobs to protect against accidental deletion.  
3. **Create Blob Container**: Create a container named `images` with anonymous read access for blobs.  
4. **Upload a Blob**: Upload a file to the container and verify its access via the blob URL.

## Outcome

By following these steps, you will have a functional Azure Blob Storage setup with a publicly accessible blob container.
